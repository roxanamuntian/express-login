# Login with express

## First express app

This is for learning purposes.

The repository contains the login and the part in which the token is generated.

Passwords were salted and hashed with [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt).

The app is not connected to a database, it uses mock data.

In order to test the app use the following username and password:<br>
..* username: John password: john<br>
..* username: Emily password: emily<br>
